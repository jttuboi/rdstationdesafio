== RDStation Desafio

This project is not finished. It was used the gem OmniAuth-Salesforce and/or the gem databasedotcom. The connection with salesforce it's OK, but it was difficult to manipulate data, example, select accounts and update one this account.
Other project is rsstationdesafio2. It is a template of a project with connections already running. I just need to find how to CRUD data.
